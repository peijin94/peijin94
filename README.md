### Hi there 👋 I am Peijin

🔭 I’m currently working on: low-frequency radio astronomy, solar radio physics, spaceweather.

🔗 More about me at [pjzhang.cc](pjzhang.cc)

🗃️ Most of my code repositories are about data processing and radio wave propagation simulations, not very well organized (but I am working on it😅), no restriction to use, and please make feedback on any glitch or inconvenience from my code, thanks!
